# 🏥 Agentic Medical RAG System

An Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed for medical domain question answering using:

- Medical device manuals  
- Medical Q&A dataset  
- Web search fallback  
- Relevance grading  
- Conditional routing  
- Self-correcting answer loop  

This project demonstrates a production-style agentic RAG architecture using structured routing and answer evaluation.

## 🚀 Problem Statement

Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with:

- Domain-specific knowledge  
- Hallucination in medical contexts  
- Outdated information  
- Long document retrieval  

This system addresses these challenges by:

- Retrieving relevant medical documents  
- Grading document relevance  
- Falling back to web search when necessary  
- Evaluating answer quality before final response
